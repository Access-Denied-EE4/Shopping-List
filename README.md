# Shopping-List
Mobile app allowing users to create shopping lists and track expiration dates of their groceries and other pertinent information etc

In this project we will be designing and implementing a shopping list app. Among 
other features, users will be able to:
 Add and remove items from a shopping list
 Track how much they are spending
 Keep track of their current groceries/household products/etc. and any 
pertinent information (e.g. expiry dates)
 Automatically add items to shopping lists on a regular basis (e.g. add milk to 
the shopping list every week)
 Share lists with other users (e.g. family members)
 etc.
